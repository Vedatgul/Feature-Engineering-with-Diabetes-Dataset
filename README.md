## Feature Engineering 

A large part of data science processes are data cleaning and variable engineering. It is aimed to clean the raw data, extract new features from the related data and transform the variables that are not suitable for entering the model. Thanks to the approaches obtained, you will acquire the necessary infrastructure to make the data set suitable for entering a machine learning model.

## Dataset 

The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA. in the USA On Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the State of Arizona. Data used for diabetes research. The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.
